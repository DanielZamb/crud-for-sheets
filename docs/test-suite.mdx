A full QUnit-based test suite is available to validate the behavior of the library, including CRUD, relations, and recent features like schema defaults.

- Repository: [QUnit for Google Apps Script](https://github.com/DanielZamb/qunit-for-google-appscript)

### Whatâ€™s inside

- Backend tests executed in Apps Script context
- UI for running the tests in a web app
- Examples covering: create/update/read/remove, many-to-many operations, and integrity checks

### How to use

1. Click the link that's in the repository README and see the tests in action.

If you want to apply the same qunit tests to your own project, you can clone the repository, see the internal plumbing done and replicate it in your own project.
