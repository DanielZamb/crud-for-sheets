# Live Webapp Demo

Experience GAS-DB in action with our comprehensive web application that demonstrates all major features of the library. This is a fully functional e-commerce management system built entirely with Google Sheets as the database.

## Try It Now

**Live Demo**: [https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx2XYI88p6MuSJZPtggWZkguAii6jI-CBEPAwlS_XV5beFSVVzR_U9H-NpkcgBF8Vc-dw/exec](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx2XYI88p6MuSJZPtggWZkguAii6jI-CBEPAwlS_XV5beFSVVzR_U9H-NpkcgBF8Vc-dw/exec)

**Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DanielZamb/crud-for-sheets-full-webapp-example)

> **Note**: The Google Sheets database for this demo is already set up and configured. You can use the app immediately to explore features without any setup.

## What This Demo Shows

This reference application implements a complete e-commerce system with:

- **5 interconnected tables**: Categories, Products, Customers, Orders, and Order Details
- **Full CRUD operations** for all entities
- **One-to-many relationships**: Categories → Products, Customers → Orders
- **Many-to-many relationships**: Orders ↔ Products via junction table
- **Advanced features**: Cascade deletion, relationship queries, data integrity checks
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS v4, DataTables, and Tom Select

---

## Features You Can Explore

### Basic CRUD Operations

Navigate through different modules in the sidebar to:

- **Create** new records with auto-validating forms
- **Read** and browse data in sortable, searchable tables
- **Update** existing records with pre-populated forms
- **Delete** records with confirmation dialogs

Each module (Categories, Products, Customers, Orders, Order Details) demonstrates standard database operations with automatic type validation and conversion.

### Relationship Management

**One-to-Many Examples:**
- Click the info button (ℹ️) on any Category to see all Products in that category
- Click the info button on any Customer to see all their Orders
- Uses `getRelatedRecords()` to efficiently query child records

**Many-to-Many Examples:**
- Use the Order Details module to explore the junction table
- View which Products are in an Order, or which Orders contain a Product
- Uses `getJunctionRecords()` to traverse the relationship in both directions

### Advanced Features Module

The "Advanced Features" section demonstrates debugging and optimization tools:

- **Enhanced Logging**: See detailed validation logs with `createWithLogs()` and `updateWithLogs()`
- **Relationship Debugging**: Use `getRelatedWithLogs()` to understand query behavior
- **Data Integrity**: Check and clean orphaned junction records
- **Query Comparison**: Compare performance of TextFinder vs Filter vs standard queries
- **Visual Styling**: Apply color schemes to sheet tables

### UI/UX Highlights

- **Global Search Bar**: Type to search across all modules (press ⌘K for quick access)
- **Command Palette**: Keyboard-driven navigation with Cmd/Ctrl+K
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback on all async operations
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

---

## Data Model

The application uses a sample e-commerce schema:

```
CATEGORY (parent)
  └─→ PRODUCT (child, via category_fk)

CUSTOMER (parent)
  └─→ ORDER (child, via customer_fk)

ORDER ←→ PRODUCT (many-to-many via ORDER_DETAIL junction table)
```

All tables include:
- Auto-generated ID column
- Auto-generated DATE column
- Type-validated fields (string, number, boolean, date)
- Optional default values
- History tables for soft deletes

---

## How to Use the App

### Navigation

1. **Sidebar Menu**: Click the hamburger icon to open the sidebar
2. **Module Selection**: Choose from Categories, Products, Customers, Orders, Order Details, or Advanced Features
3. **Search**: Use the top search bar or press ⌘K (Ctrl+K on Windows) for quick navigation

### Creating Records

1. Navigate to any module
2. Click the **Create** button
3. Fill out the form (foreign key dropdowns auto-populate)
4. Click **Submit**
5. Refresh the table to see your new record

### Editing Records

1. Find a record in the table
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the Actions column
3. Modify the pre-populated form
4. Click **Update**
5. The table refreshes automatically

### Deleting Records

1. Find a record in the table
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the Actions column
3. Confirm the deletion in the popup
4. The record moves to the history table

### Viewing Relationships

**For One-to-Many:**
- In Categories table: Click the info button to see related Products
- In Customers table: Click the info button to see related Orders

**For Many-to-Many:**
- Go to Order Details module
- Click "Read Junction Records"
- Choose direction: Orders → Products or Products → Orders
- Enter the ID and view related records

## Important Notes for Developers

### The Sheets Are Pre-Configured

The demo webapp uses a Google Spreadsheet that's already set up with:
- All required tables created
- Sample data populated
- Proper schema configuration
- History tables for soft deletes

You can experiment freely - your changes won't affect other users (each user gets their own instance).

### Forking and Customization

If you want to **fork this project** and run your own version:

1. **Clone the repository**: [test-db-webapp on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielZamb/crud-for-sheets-full-webapp-example)
2. **Create a new Google Sheet**: You'll need your own blank spreadsheet
3. **Update the Sheet ID**: In `server.js`, replace the spreadsheet ID in the `DB.init()` call
4. **Run `createSchema()`**: Execute this function once from the Apps Script editor to create all tables
5. **Deploy as Web App**: Follow the deployment instructions in the repo's README

The repository includes:
- Complete server-side code (`server.js`)
- All HTML templates (`index.html`, `main.js.html`, `styles.css.html`)
- Configuration files (`.clasp.json`, `appsscript.json`)
- Deployment instructions using CLASP

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CDN browser build)
- Bootstrap Icons (icons only, no Bootstrap JS)
- DataTables (table sorting/search/pagination)
- Tom Select (enhanced select dropdowns)
- SweetAlert2 (modern dialogs and toasts)
- Plain JavaScript for custom interactions

**Backend:**
- Google Apps Script
- GAS-DB library (this project)
- Google Sheets as database

---

## Use Cases

This demo is perfect for:

- **Learning GAS-DB**: See all features in action with a real-world example
- **Reference Implementation**: Use as a template for your own projects
- **Testing Ideas**: Experiment with relationships and CRUD operations
- **Demonstrations**: Show stakeholders what's possible with Google Sheets as a database
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Fork and customize for quick MVPs

---

## What Makes This Different

- **Interactive Experience**: Click, create, update, delete in real-time
- **Visual Feedback**: See how data flows through relationships
- **Production-Ready UI**: Modern interface patterns you can adapt
- **Complete Functionality**: Every feature of GAS-DB demonstrated
- **No Setup Required**: Just click the link and start exploring
