title: Requesting New Features
description: How to suggest and discuss new features for the project.
---

We love community input! If you’d like to suggest a new feature, please follow the guidelines below to ensure your request gets the attention and discussion it deserves.

## Where to Submit Feature Requests

**Preferred:**
Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/DanielZamb/crud-for-sheets/discussions) in the **“Ideas & Feature Requests”** category. This helps the community and maintainers evaluate, comment, and refine ideas before formalizing them as issues.

**Direct Pull Requests:**
If you’re sure about the feature’s value and implementation scope, **just make a pull request!** and make sure that all tests pass.
This is great for smaller features or improvements that you can implement yourself. But please do explain the feature in the PR description, so maintainers understand its purpose and context.

## What to Include in Your Feature Request

For best results, please provide:

- **A clear, descriptive title.**
  (e.g., “Support for Optimistic Concurrency in GSDB”)
- **A summary of the problem or need.**
  What’s missing, or what pain point would this feature solve?
- **A description of the proposed solution.**
  (If you have one in mind. Even rough ideas are helpful!)
- **Relevant use cases or scenarios.**
  Real-world examples of how you (or others) would use this.
- **Optional:**
  - Links to related issues, prior discussions, or similar features in other projects.
  - Screenshots or diagrams, if visualizing the workflow helps.

## Feature Request Template

Here’s a template you can copy-paste when starting a new Discussion or Issue:

```
**Feature Title:**
Short and descriptive.

**Problem/Use Case:**
What’s the current limitation? Why is this important?

**Proposed Solution:**
How would you like this to work? (You can be brief or detailed.)

**Additional Context:**
Any related links, examples, or screenshots.
```

## What Happens Next?

- Maintainers and contributors will discuss your idea.
- If there’s enough interest and a clear plan, we’ll move the request to a tracked issue and add it to the roadmap.
- For popular/complex features, we may ask for more feedback.

## FINAL NOTE

This is an open source project, and while we genuinely appreciate all contributions and feature requests, we can’t guarantee that every suggestion will be implemented.

We also reserve the right to close discussions or issues that don’t align with the project’s goals or scope. If you misuse GitHub issues or fail to communicate respectfully with the community, your ability to contribute (including future feature requests or pull requests) may be **revoked**.

Let’s keep it collaborative and constructive, thanks for helping make this project better!
