# ðŸ“¦ Installation

### 1. Copy the Class Manually

Currently, the simplest route is to copy the `CrudForSheets.js` file into your own Apps Script project.

_(When a more direct way to share the library publicly is available, you can replace these steps with the official method.)_

### 2. (Future) Add as a Library

1. **Open Google Apps Script Editor**

   - Go to your Google Sheets.
   - Click on `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.

2. **Add the Library**

   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the `+` icon next to `Libraries`.
   - Enter the Library ID:
     ```
     1flBjZa3u09YAgozp3H-GEhkxpl61rbB2QW2SKnV7ZVlRHNhgxZydegDG
     ```
   - Select the latest version and add it to your project.

3. **Use the Library**
   - You can now use the `DB` class from the library to manage your spreadsheets.
