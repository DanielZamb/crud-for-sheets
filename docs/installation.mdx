## 1. (At last, i finally made it available to) Add as a Library

1. **Open Google Apps Script Editor**

   - Go to your Google Sheets.
   - Click on `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.

2. **Add the Library**

   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the `+` icon next to `Libraries`.
   - Enter the Library ID:
     ```1TJEgrBnjb_B8PVCnHstDzMmllYqR2dZuBVQUvprPYohST5uwPBuuxfcI```
   - Select the latest version and add it to your project.

3. **Use the Library**
   - You can now use the `gasDB` class from the library to manage your spreadsheets.


## 2. Copy the Class Manually ( Not Recommended )

The simplest route is to copy the `CrudForSheets.js` file into your own Apps Script project.
> beware: This is not recommended as you will not be able to receive updates to the library.
