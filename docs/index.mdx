Welcome to docs.page! The init command you just ran has created a basic file struture in your project to help you get started.

## Walkthrough

### Configuration

In the root of your directory a new `docs.json` file has been created. This file is used to configure your documentation site. You can customize the name, description, and sidebar, theme, logos and more using this file.

Here's a basic example of what the file looks like:

```
{
  "name": "My Docs",
  "description": "My documentation site",
  "sidebar": [
  {
    "group": "Getting Started",
    "pages": [
      {
        "title": "Getting to know docs.page",
        "href": "/",
        "icon": "rocket"
      },
      {
        "title": "Next Steps",
        "href": "/next-steps",
        "icon": "arrow-right"
      }
    ]
  }
]
}
```

To learn more about the advanced configuration options, check out the [docs](https://use.docs.page/configuration).

### Content

docs.page uses the `docs` directory to store your documentation pages. Two pages have been created for you:

- `index.mdx` - The home page of your documentation site, resolves to the root URL.
- `next-steps.mdx` - A page to help you get started with docs.page, resolves to `/next-steps`.

Documentation can be written using the standard [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and also supports the use of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), 
with the ability to render custom [components](https://use.docs.page/components) for more advanced use cases.

## Preview

To preview your documentation site, head over to [https://docs.page/preview](https://docs.page/preview) in your browser and open this directory.

Previewing your documentation site will allow you to see the changes you make in real-time before you publish to the world.
