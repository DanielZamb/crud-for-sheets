## 🚀 Initialization

Initialize the database by creating a new instance of the `DB` class. You can either create a new spreadsheet or connect to an existing one using its ID.

```js
/**
 * Initialize the database.
 */

// Declare db in your global scope in order to use it in any part of the script
const db = DB.init("MyDatabase");
// OR connect to an existing spreadsheet using its ID
const existingDb = DB.init("ExistingDatabase", "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID");

function seeSchemaCreation() {
  // Log the creation result
  console.log(db.getCreationResult());
}
```

> Note that the `seeSchemaCreation()` is just a helper function to see the result of the schema creation. You can remove it after you see the result in the console.
> If you dont want to see the result, you can remove the function, but you must have at least one or more functions in your `code.gs` file, otherwise the script will not run.

When you hit Run on the `seeSchemaCreation` function **for the first time**, you will see an Oauth consent screen, asking for permissions to access your Google Sheets. This is because the library needs to create a new spreadsheet/handle any spreadsheets you store in the database schema.

After you grant the permissions, this screen may appear

As the library is not verified by Google, you will need to click on `Advanced` and then `Go to <Your Project Name> (unsafe)` to proceed.

As the code is open-source, you can review it before proceeding and reassure yourself that it is safe to use.

After that the script will run, and you will see a new spreadsheet created in your Google Drive with the name `MyDatabase` (or now you can manage `ExistingDatabase` if you provided an ID).

## 🛠️ Creating Tables

Define and create tables within your spreadsheet. Each table represents a sheet with specified fields and types.

```js
/**
 * Create tables in the database.
 */
let tables = []
const db = DB.init('MyDatabase');
const employeeTableConfig;
const departmentTableConfig;

function createTables() {

  // Define configuration for the EMPLOYEES table
  employeeTableConfig = {
    tableName: "EMPLOYEES",
    historyTableName: "DELETED_EMPLOYEES",
    fields: {
      name: { type: "string", treatEmptyStringAsMissing: true },
      age: "number",
      position: "string",
      employed: { type: "boolean", default: true },
      hire_date: { type: "date", default: "now" },
    }
  };

  // Create the EMPLOYEES table
  const createResult = db.createTable(employeeTableConfig);
  console.log("Employee table created:", createResult);

  // Define configuration for the DEPARTMENTS table
  departmentTableConfig = {
    tableName: "DEPARTMENTS",
    historyTableName: "DELETED_DEPARTMENTS",
    fields: {
      department_name: "string",
      manager_id: "number",
      location: "string",
    }
  };

  // Create the DEPARTMENTS table
  const deptCreateResult = db.createTable(departmentTableConfig);
  console.log("Departments table created:", deptCreateResult);

  tables.push(employeeTableConfig);
  tables.push(departmentTableConfig);
}
```

> **⚠️ Important First-Time Setup**: You must run the `createTables()` function **once** from the Google Apps Script editor to physically create the sheet tabs in your spreadsheet. After the sheets are created, you don't need to run it again.
>
> **To do this:**
> 1. Open the Google Apps Script editor
> 2. Select `createTables` from the function dropdown menu at the top
> 3. Click the **Run** button (▶️)
> 4. Grant any required permissions when prompted
>
> The sheets will be created in your spreadsheet and are ready to use. You only need to do this once per database setup.

After creation, remember that you **must** place them into the DB Context, otherwise they wont be available to operate with.
I Recomend doing this as separate declarations, if there are few tables.
If there's a hefty amount of tables, you can loop through them and place them into the context.

```js
tables.forEach((table) => {
  console.log(db.putTableIntoDbContext(table));
});
```

## Key Points

1. **You leave the code for putting tables in the schema context** outside of any function, in the global scope, as `.gs` files are stateless, and will be called in a `clean slate` state each and every time any `google.script.run` is called in your `main.js`.
2. **You have the tables defined** in the global scope, so you can access them from anywhere in your script.
3. **You have the DB instance** defined in the global scope, so you can access it from anywhere in your script (either by copying the script or adding the library).
4. **You actually did placed the tables into the context** before using them in your CRUD operations.

## ✨ Schema Defaults and Missing-Value Flags

You can define defaults in your schema so the DB fills values automatically when they are not provided (or considered missing), and you can control what counts as “missing”.

- Define defaults using an object form `{ type, default?, treatNullAsMissing?, treatEmptyStringAsMissing? }` for each field.
- Special default value `"now"` auto-fills the current date/time for `date` fields.
- If a field has a default, it is not required in `keyOrder`.
- Defaults are applied before validation and type checking.

Example:

```javascript
const employeeTableConfig = {
  tableName: "EMPLOYEES",
  fields: {
    name: { type: "string", treatEmptyStringAsMissing: true },
    age: "number",
    position: "string",
    employed: { type: "boolean", default: true },
    hire_date: { type: "date", default: "now" },
  },
};

db.createTable(employeeTableConfig);
db.putTableIntoDbContext(employeeTableConfig);

// This works even if you omit employed and hire_date:
db.create("EMPLOYEES", { name: "Eve", age: 27, position: "Analyst" }, [
  "name",
  "age",
  "position",
  // employed and hire_date are optional here due to defaults
]);
```

Missing-value flags behavior:

- `treatNullAsMissing: true` → `null` will be replaced by the default (if present)
- `treatEmptyStringAsMissing: true` → `""` will be replaced by the default (if present)

You can continue adding more **basic** usage instructions here (e.g., how to handle data, read records, etc.).
For _advanced usage_, see [docs/advanced-examples](/advanced-examples).

## 🎨 Applying Color Schemes

Enhance the visual appeal of your sheets by applying predefined color themes.

```javascript
const db = DB.init("MyDatabase");

/**
 * Apply a color scheme to the EMPLOYEES table.
 */
function applyColorScheme() {
  // Apply the 'blue' color scheme
  db.applyColorScheme("EMPLOYEES", "blue");

  console.log("Color scheme applied to EMPLOYEES table.");
}
```
