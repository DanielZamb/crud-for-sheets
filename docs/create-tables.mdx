## 🚀 Initialization

Initialize the database by creating a new instance of the `DB` class. You can either create a new spreadsheet or connect to an existing one using its ID.

```js
/**
 * Initialize the database.
 */

// Declare db in your global scope in order to use it in any part of the script
const db;
const existingDb;

function initializeDatabase() {
  // Initialize a new spreadsheet database
  db = DB.init('MyDatabase');

  // OR connect to an existing spreadsheet using its ID
  existingDb = DB.init('ExistingDatabase', 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID');

  // Log the creation result
  console.log(db.getCreationResult());
}
```

## 🛠️ Creating Tables

Define and create tables within your spreadsheet. Each table represents a sheet with specified fields and types.

```js
/**
 * Create tables in the database.
 */
let tables = []
const db = DB.init('MyDatabase');
const employeeTableConfig;
const departmentTableConfig;

function createTables() {

  // Define configuration for the EMPLOYEES table
  employeeTableConfig = {
    tableName: "EMPLOYEES",
    historyTableName: "DELETED_EMPLOYEES",
    fields: {
      name: "string",
      age: "number",
      position: "string",
      employed: "boolean",
      hire_date: "date",
    }
  };

  // Create the EMPLOYEES table
  const createResult = db.createTable(employeeTableConfig);
  console.log("Employee table created:", createResult);

  // Define configuration for the DEPARTMENTS table
  departmentTableConfig = {
    tableName: "DEPARTMENTS",
    historyTableName: "DELETED_DEPARTMENTS",
    fields: {
      department_name: "string",
      manager_id: "number",
      location: "string",
    }
  };

  // Create the DEPARTMENTS table
  const deptCreateResult = db.createTable(departmentTableConfig);
  console.log("Departments table created:", deptCreateResult);

  tables.push(employeeTableConfig);
  tables.push(departmentTableConfig);
}
```

After creation, remember that you **must** place them into the DB Context, otherwise they wont be available to operate with. 
I Recomend doing this as separate declarations, if there are few tables.
If there's a hefty amount of tables, you can loop through them and place them into the context.


```js
tables.forEach((table) => {
  console.log(db.putTableIntoDbContext(table));
});
```

## Key Points:

1. **You leave the code for putting tables in the schema context** outside of any function, in the global scope, as `.gs` files are stateless, and will be called in a `clean slate` state each and every time any `google.script.run` is called in your `main.js`.
2. **You have the tables defined** in the global scope, so you can access them from anywhere in your script.
3. **You have the DB instance** defined in the global scope, so you can access it from anywhere in your script (either by copying the script or adding the library).
4. **You actually did placed the tables into the context** before using them in your CRUD operations.
