## 🎉 What's New in v1.0.0

1. **Concurrency Locks**

- **Locking for Create/Update/Delete** operations to prevent concurrent writes on the same record.
- New methods:
  - `releaseLocks()`: Frees all active locks held by this instance.
- Automatically applied in `create`, `update`, and `remove`.

2. **Many-to-Many Relationship Support**

- Easily create and manage **junction tables**.
- New methods:
  - `createManyToManyTableConfig(config)`: Generates a ready-to-use table config for a junction (relation) table.
  - `createJunctionRecord(junctionTableName, data, keyOrder)`: Creates a new entry in the junction table.
  - `getJunctionRecords(junctionTableName, sourceTableName, targetTableName, sourceId, options)`: Returns related records from a junction.
  - `updateJunctionRecord(junctionTableName, id, data, keyOrder)`: Updates an existing record in the junction table.

3. **Cascade Deletion**

- `removeWithCascade(tableName, historyTableName, id)`: Removes a parent record and automatically deletes or archives the related records from associated junction tables.

4. **Bulk Read**

- `readIdList(tableName, ids)`: Allows you to read multiple records by their IDs in a single call.

5. **Integrity Checks**

- `checkTableIntegrity(junctionTableName, junctionHistoryTableName)`: Scans a junction table for invalid foreign key references and moves them to history if the parent records no longer exist.

6. **Enhanced Logging & Debug**

- Variants such as `createWithLogs()` and `updateWithLogs()` provide verbose logging to aid in debugging.
